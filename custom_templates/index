# First line is the header fields for columns and is mandatory.
# Regular expressions are supported in all fields except the first.
# Last field supports variable length command completion.
# abc[[xyz]] is expanded to abc(x(y(z)?)?)?, regexp inside [[]] is not supported
#
# Rules of Ordering:
#  - OS in alphabetical order
#  - Template name in length order (longest to shortest)
#  - When Length is the same, use alphabetical order
#  - Keep space between OS's
#
# Example:
# alcatel_aos_show_interfaces_ethernet.textfsm, .*, alcatel_aos, sh[[ow]] (in[[terfaces]] e[[thernet]]|in[[terfaces]])$
# cisco_ios_show_ip_route.textfsm, .*, cisco_ios, sh[[ow]] ip r[[oute]]
